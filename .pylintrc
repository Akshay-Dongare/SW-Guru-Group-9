[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# C0114: Missing module docstring (we enforce this, but maybe not everywhere)
# C0103: Invalid name (variables like 'i', 'x', 'f' are fine in short scopes)
# C0301: Line too long (we bump this to 120 chars)
# R0903: Too few public methods (classes used for structure often have few methods)
