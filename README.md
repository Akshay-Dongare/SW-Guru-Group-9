<br>

> **[📂 Go to Homework 1 Folder](./Homework%201)**

Refactored a legacy "spaghetti code" script into a modular, clean architecture.

* **Key Heuristics Applied:**
    * Separation of Concerns (SoC)
    * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    * Mechanism vs. Policy (Config separated from Logic)
* **Bonuses Implemented:**
    1.  Multiple Output Formats (JSON/CSV)
    2.  External Data Loading (`stopwords.txt`)
    3.  Unit Testing (`unittest`)
    4.  Internationalization (Spanish Support)
* **Verification:**
    * Includes a `Makefile` for automated grading checks.
    * Passes strict `diff` checks against the original script.

## 🔧 Development & Code Quality

We use **Poetry** to manage dependencies and **Pylint** to enforce strict code quality (Guru Standards).

### 1. Setup
Install all dependencies (including the linter and formatter):
```bash
make install
```

### 2. Auto-Formatting
To automatically fix whitespace, indentation, and style violations:
```bash
poetry run autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --recursive "Homework 1"
```

### 3. Verify Quality
To run the full repo-wide check (Target Score: > 8.0/10):
```bash
make lint
```
